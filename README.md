## Lab 1. Caesar cipher. One-to-one substitution cipher.

Whole task in [KG_PZ_1.pdf](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-lab-1/blob/master/KG_PZ_1.pdf). Whole report in [CGT-lab1.docx](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-lab-1/blob/master/CGT-lab1.docx) 
and [CGT-lab1.pdf](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-lab-1/blob/master/CGT-lab1.pdf).

Task 1. Write a decryption program to find the plaintext by breaking the Caesar cipher; 
find the key of the one-to-one substitution cipher, using the found plaintext.

Task 2. Write a program to encrypt the full name, decrypt the received text. Compare the resulting text with the original text.
