## Lab 1. Caesar cipher. One-to-one substitution cipher.

The task is located in [KG_PZ_1.pdf](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-labs/blob/master/tasks/KG_PZ_1.pdf) file.

Task 1. Write a decryption program to find the plaintext by breaking the Caesar cipher; 
find the key of the one-to-one substitution cipher, using the found plaintext.

Task 2. Write a program to encrypt the full name, decrypt the received text. Compare the resulting text with the original text.

## Lab 2. Transposition cipher. Playfair cipher.
 
The task is located in [KG_PZ_2.pdf](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-labs/blob/master/tasks/KG_PZ_2.pdf) file.
 
 Task 1. Find key of Playfair cipher.
 
 Task 2. Encrypt the full name using transposition cipher.
 
 Task 3. Encrypt the full name using Playfair cipher.
 
 ## Lab 3. XOR cipher.
 
The task is located in [KG_PZ_3.pdf](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-labs/blob/master/tasks/KG_PZ_3.pdf) file.

Task 1. Encrypt message with a gamma-key.

Task 2. Decrypt result with the same gamma-key.

## Lab 4. PGP.

The task is located in [KG_PZ_3.pdf](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-labs/blob/master/tasks/KG_PZ_4.pdf) file.

Task 1. Convert 3^43 to the binary system.

Task 2. Convert the alphabet to binary values from 0000(2) to 1111(2) and covert the message according to the binary alphabet 
to the binary code.

Task 3. Shift digits of the binary code of the number.

Task 4. Find XOR of 2 values.
