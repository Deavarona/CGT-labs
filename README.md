## Lab 1. Caesar cipher. One-to-one substitution cipher.

The task is located in [KG_PZ_1.pdf](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-lab-1/blob/master/KG_PZ_1.pdf) file. The report is located in [CGT-lab1.docx](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-lab-1/blob/master/CGT-lab1.docx) and [CGT-lab1.pdf](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-lab-1/blob/master/CGT-lab1.pdf) files.

Task 1. Write a decryption program to find the plaintext by breaking the Caesar cipher; 
find the key of the one-to-one substitution cipher, using the found plaintext.

Task 2. Write a program to encrypt the full name, decrypt the received text. Compare the resulting text with the original text.

## Lab 2. Transposition cipher. Playfair cipher.
 
The task is located in [KG_PZ_2.pdf](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-labs/blob/master/src/main/tasks/lab-2/KG_PZ_2.pdf) file. The report is located in [CGT-lab2.pdf](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-labs/blob/master/src/main/tasks/lab-2/CGT-lab2.pdf) and [CGT-lab2.docx](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-labs/blob/master/src/main/tasks/lab-2/CGT-lab2.docx) files.
 
 Task 1. Find key of Playfair cipher.
 
 Task 2. Encrypt the full name using transposition cipher.
 
 Task 3. Encrypt the full name using Playfair cipher.
 
 ## Lab 3. XOR cipher.
 
The task is located in [KG_PZ_3.pdf](https://github.com/Kkotto/CGT-labs/blob/master/src/main/tasks/lab-3/KG_PZ_3.pdf) file.

Task 1. Encrypt message with a gamma-key.

Task 2. Decrypt result with the same gamma-key.
